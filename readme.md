
This is a presentation of my idea for a public companies security info verifer app.


1- first problem addressed in the presentation: There are times that the amount security of a ticker traded on Nasdaq  and Market cap associated with a stock 
is not exactly what it seems as  google or yahoo finance shows. You might miss an 8K form, which shows significant amount of change in outstanding shares.
This app tries to give a little insight to it (Not financial advice).

2- So for making the app, ofcourse there has to be other functions. So here is another ability to show the candle chart of the desired stock for different periods.

Interfaces used: 1-EDGAR Application Programming Interfaces.

                 2-yahoo finance.

3- AI interface is incomplete here, needs an AI-API service for buisness to be fully applicable or a local comprehensive AI finance model.
