
This is a demo of my idea for a public companies security infor verifer app.

Disclaimer:"Do not use this app to make financial decision. I made this as an exercise, this version in github is incomplete and will contain errors, therefore do not 
make your trading decisions based on it and consult to a financial advisor."

Problem: A lot of times the amount security of a ticker traded on Nasdaq stock exchange and Market cap associated with a stock 
is not exactly what it seems. You might miss an 8K form, which shows significant amount of change in outstanding shares.
This app tries to give a little insight to it and it is not financial advice AGAIN!.
